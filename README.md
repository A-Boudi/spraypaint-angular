# jsorm

This library provides an interface to APIs following the JSONAPI spec. Though we're not striving for 1:1 compatibility with Active Record, you'll see it's the same basic usage, from scopes to error handling.

Written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and distributed in ES5, this library is isomorphic - use it from the browser, or from node.

(Open to better names for this lib :grin:)

### Roadmap

* Find to throw error when record not found
* Authentication from Node
* Attribute transforms (type coercion)
* Writes
* Error / Validation handling
* Nested Writes
* Statistics
